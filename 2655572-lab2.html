                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Zaneerah Essop. I am currently studying in my third year of Computer Science. That's about it about myself and where anything related to my interests ends.</p>

                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>My latest project included a mobile app that focuses on finding missing people. This was based on an important feature such as geo-tagging. It included being able to report a missing person, upload their information, and use geo-tagging to pinpoint their locations. This project, however, did not progress far, but I hope to complete it one day.</p>
